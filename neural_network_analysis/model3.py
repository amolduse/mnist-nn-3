Target:
    1. Improve the architecture of previously trained network by adding following features one by one and observing the impact- 
        a. Add max pooling at correct location
        b. Add image augmentation
        c. Add schedulers / step LR
    2. Keep parameters under 8k and achieve accuracy of 99.4% on test set consistently.
Result:
    1. Parameters: 
        a. Max pooling after receptive field of 5x5 (after 2 conv layers) - 8k
        b. After image augmentation and some parameter changing 7.1k
        c. Added more image augmentation to increase data size so that model can learn better and not underfit. - 7.1k
        d. By adding schedular with StepLR 7.1k
    2. Best Train Accuracy: 
        a. Max pooling after receptive field of 5x5 (after 2 conv layers) -  98.59
        b. After image augmentation and some parameter changing 7.1k 98.69
        c. Added more image augmentation to increase data size so that model can learn better and not underfit. - 98.33
        d. By adding schedular with StepLR 99.01
    3. Best Test Accuracy:
        a. Max pooling after receptive field of 5x5 (after 2 conv layers) -  99.27
        b. After image augmentation and some parameter changing - 99.29
        c. Added more image augmentation to increase data size so that model can learn better and not underfit. - 99.34
        d. By adding schedular with StepLR 99.43

Analysis:
    1. After adding max pooling after 2 conv layers (receptive field of 5x5) accuracy but gap between train and test accuracy didn't improve.
       The network was not overfitting but it was underfitting. So, I added image augmentation to increase the data size.
    2. After adding image augmentation accuracy improved but still there was gap between train and test accuracy and didn't achieve the desired result.
    3. As network was not learning in lower parameters I increased the dataset by adding more image augmentation which gave promissing result of test
       accuracy of 99.34%.
    4. Finally after adding schedular with StepLR I achieved the desired result of 99.43% test accuracy.

Summary:
    Tried three models with different architecture and parameters. The final model is defined in model3.py which has 7.1k parameters and achieves
    99.43% accuracy on test set and 99.01% accuracy on train set. 
    In this excersise I learnt how important it is to choose the right architecture and parameters to achieve the desired result.
